# Weatherapp
 Weather Application Project using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.
 
The application is developed in a MVC architecture. It supports rapid and parallel development. The MVC pattern helps you break up the frontend and backend code into separate components. This way, it's much easier to manage and make changes to either side without them interfering with each other.
